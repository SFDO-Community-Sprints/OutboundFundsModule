# Past Project Teams
We recommend creating a Wiki page for past Sprint Event volunteers (per Sprint), and that Sprints goals, accomplishments, etc. Here's a good example: https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/DataGenerationToolkit. If you prefer to add this information to the readme file, here's a good example of formatting you can use: https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Admin-Skills-and-Nonprofit-Salesforce-Teams

# Project Resources and Documentation
Documentation can be found in the repository [wiki] (URL for wiki where docs are stored)

# Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)
Replace with the goals your team would like to continue working on next time.

The Outbound Funds app is a community developed and maintained Open Source Commons project. It is a customizable foundation for managing funds awarded by your organization, like grants, scholarships or internal funding.

**Important note about Funding Requests as of July 2019**:
If you were an early adopter of the Outbound Funds package, the Funding Request object had a master-detail relationship with Funding Program when you installed it. However, various members of the community requested that this relationship be changed to a lookup to provide more flexibility. This change was made generally available with package version 1.15 as of 7/11/2019. To learn about updating to version 1.15, see the [Funding Request Object documentation](https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/OutboundFundsModule/wiki/Funding-Request-Object).
