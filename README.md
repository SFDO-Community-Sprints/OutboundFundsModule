## Latest Release

Winter '22 ‚òÉÔ∏è ‚òï üéø

**Important note about Funding Requests as of July 2019**:
If you were an early adopter of the Outbound Funds package, the Funding Request object had a master-detail relationship with Funding Program when you installed it. However, various members of the community requested that this relationship be changed to a lookup to provide more flexibility. This change was made generally available with package version 1.15 as of 7/11/2019. To learn about updating to version 1.15, see the [Funding Request Object documentation](https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/OutboundFundsModule/wiki/Funding-Request-Object).

# Project Overview
## Vision & Goals
The Outbound Funds app is an open source customizable foundation for managing funds awarded by your organization, like grants, scholarships or internal funding. 

This former Open Source Commons community app has been officially adopted by Salesforce.org but is still free and open source and will continue to be a big part of our Sprints. The core team of volunteers continue to work on the project regularly alongside Salesforce.org Engineers and Product Managers.

Community Team Goals:
* Support the community
* Develop new features as open source contributions to the Outbound Funds Module
* Provide feedback on new Outbound Funds Module features developed by the Salesforce.org product team
* Advise on Grants Management Package
